Users can see an image, and when the MAGIC button is clicked, the image divides into 16 3D boxes, with the images still inside but broken up into the boxes

Each box and the large box, have a 3D effect

Used a gif for animation look and feel

Also has a spinning effect as animation when going from 1 box to 16
